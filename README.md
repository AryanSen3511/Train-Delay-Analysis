# Train-Delay-Analysis

### This project uses Python and Pandas , Power Bi , Excellec for data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare the dataset for analysis and visualization.

This Train Delay Analysis project focuses on analyzing real-world railway data, including station names, delay durations, and train cancellation records. The dataset is processed and visualized using charts and graphs to identify patterns, peak delay times, and performance issues. The insights gained from this analysis help in understanding the root causes of delays and support decision-making to improve the railway system efficiency and passenger experience.

## 🚀 Key Features of Dashboard

📌 Delay Analysis Information : In the dashboard, we represent key insights such as average delay (minutes), average cancellations Percentage, trains running on time, and an overall train status matrix for performance evaluation.
